You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Download the dataset if it does not exist in your working directory
2. Load the training and test datasets
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Correct the column names
5. Merges all the datasets
6. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
7. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.
   
 
   

The end result is shown in the file `TidyData.txt`.
